### React Event Handling

Completed:
- Learned how React handles user interactions through event handlers
- Used onClick to trigger state updates
- Practiced onMouseOver and onMouseOut events
- Managed UI changes using useState
- Implemented conditional styling based on user interaction
- Strengthened understanding of React re-rendering on state change

Key Takeaway:
React event handlers allow components to respond to user actions. State should represent behavior (like hover or click), while UI styles should be derived from that state.
